# üìñ LibraryApp

LibraryApp is a modern web application designed to streamline library operations, making it ideal for small community libraries in offices, schools, or residential complexes. It enables users to browse, borrow, and return books effortlessly while providing administrators with powerful tools to manage inventory, handle book requests, and keep users informed through Slack notifications. Built with a Mobile First design approach, LibraryApp ensures an intuitive and seamless user experience across all devices.

### Regular users can:
- Borrow books by scanning barcodes.
- Request new books to be added to the library.
- Reserve books that are currently unavailable.
- Extend their loans if the book is not reserved.
- Receive Slack notifications for due date reminders or when requested books are added to the library.

### Administrators can:
- Add new books by scanning their barcodes.
- Track and manage book inventory.
- Promote other users to administrators.
- Process book requests and notify requesters via Slack.
