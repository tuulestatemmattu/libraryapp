  "description": "\"Whenever you read Refactoring], it's time to read it again. And if you haven't read it yet, please do before writing another line of code.\" -David Heinemeier Hansson, Creator of Ruby on Rails, Founder & CTO at Basecamp Fully Revised and Updated--Includes New Refactorings and Code Examples \"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\" -M. Fowler (1999) For more than twenty years, experienced programmers worldwide have relied on Martin Fowler's Refactoring to improve the design of existing code and to enhance software maintainability, as well as to make existing code easier to understand.
